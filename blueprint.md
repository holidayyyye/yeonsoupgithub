# Lotto Drawing App Blueprint

## Overview

This document outlines the design and implementation of a simple, visually appealing, and interactive lottery drawing web application. The application will generate and display a set of winning lottery numbers.

## Project Outline

### Design and Features

*   **Modern Aesthetics:** The application will have a clean, modern design with a visually balanced layout, expressive typography, and a vibrant color palette.
*   **Responsive Design:** The layout will be fully responsive and adapt to different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience on both mobile and desktop devices.
*   **Interactive Elements:** The app will feature a "Generate Numbers" button with interactive feedback. The winning numbers will be displayed with an engaging animation.
*   **Visual Effects:** The design will incorporate subtle textures, multi-layered drop shadows for a sense of depth, and gradient effects to create a premium feel.
*   **Accessibility:** The application will be designed with accessibility in mind, ensuring it is usable by people with a wide range of abilities.

### Core Functionality

*   **Number Generation:** The application will generate 6 unique random numbers between 1 and 45.
*   **User Interface:**
    *   A clear and prominent title.
    *   A dedicated section to display the generated lottery numbers.
    *   A button to initiate the lottery draw.

## Current Plan

*   **HTML Structure:** Create the basic HTML structure for the title, number display area, and the "Generate" button in `index.html`.
*   **CSS Styling:** Implement the visual design using modern CSS in `style.css`. This will include layout, colors, fonts, shadows, and animations.
*   **JavaScript Logic:** Write the JavaScript code in `main.js` to handle the lottery number generation and update the UI when the button is clicked.
